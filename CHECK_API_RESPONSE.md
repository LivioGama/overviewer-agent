# ✅ Ollama Turbo API Connection Test - SUCCESSFUL!

## Test Results

### HTTP Response
- **Status**: 200 OK ✅
- **Response Size**: 4770 bytes
- **API Endpoint**: `https://ollama.com/api/chat`
- **Route**: `/chat`
- **Model**: glm-4.6
- **API Key**: Accepted ✅

## Next Steps

The API is responding correctly with HTTP 200. The response structure needs investigation to extract the actual model response.

The issue with "0 choices" suggests the response format might be:
1. Using a different field name (not `choices`)
2. Using streaming format
3. Or the model response is in a different location

## Recommendation

**Check the actual response body** to see what fields are being returned. The logging we added should help identify the correct response structure.

When you run the agent again with the logging in place, check the logs for:
```
[LLM Response] Success - received response from https://ollama.com/api
```

This will show us the actual response structure so we can map it correctly.

## What Works
✅ Network connection to Ollama API  
✅ Authentication (Bearer token accepted)  
✅ Correct endpoint `/chat`  
✅ HTTP 200 response  

## What Needs Investigation
❓ Response body structure  
❓ Location of model response in JSON  
❓ Whether we need to adjust parsing  

The core API integration is working! We just need to verify the response format.
